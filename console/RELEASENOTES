Version 0.2.1 - 12 Sept 2009
Initial Hosted Release of web3270

I-0005 (Update - Resolved in 0.2.2)
Extended Attributes have been mapped to the start of HTML fields. This is a
blunder as (for example) context highlighting in editors creates multiple
fields. This worked OK in MVS 3.8 but I will be obliged change the system
(in the next version) to ignore all but the first extended highlight
attributes (and have rules to either ignore it anyway or apply it to the
whole field) in an unprotected field

I-0003 (Update - reported working on Mac/Safari)
Primary testing has been done in IE and Windows. Firefox with Windows and
Linux has been tested although this currently seems less stable (There are
some issues with firefox - see later). I do not believe this will work with
a Mac and/or other browsers and I have not got access to a Mac.

I-0003 (Update - Ignored, nothing to be done)
Firefox does not support OVERWRITE mode (i.e. rather than INSERT). The
Firefox folks do not see the need for OVERWRITE (and want to use the INSERT
key for other purposes). A bit of an issue for 3270 emulation...

I-0002 (Update - Resolved in 0.2.2)
In Firefox on a hidden field you cannot see the cursor 

I-0001 (Update - Ignored, nothing to be done)
Firefox screen redraw seems slow (or at least is not "double buffered" in
that you can see the fields being redrawn)
